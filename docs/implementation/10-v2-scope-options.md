# V2 Scope Options

Date: 2026-06-30

## Purpose

This document lists candidate V2 directions after V1 acceptance. It is a
planning document, not implementation authorization.

V1 is accepted as a local-first AI testing evidence workbench. V2 should extend
that evidence loop deliberately, one small slice at a time, without turning
previous V1 non-goals into accidental default scope.

## V1 Baseline

Accepted V1 evidence:

- Release package: `docs/release/v1/README.md`
- Acceptance evidence: `docs/release/v1/acceptance-evidence.md`
- Manual walkthrough: `docs/release/v1/manual-walkthrough.md`
- Final handoff: `docs/implementation/08-v1-final-acceptance-handoff.md`

Current V1 automated gate:

- Backend golden release-acceptance suite: `10 passed`.
- Frontend workbench suite: `14` test files passed, `17 tests passed`.
- `git diff --check`: clean.

## Candidate Direction A: RAG Knowledge Runtime

Problem:

- V1 exposes RAG 知识库 as a ContextArtifact and KnowledgeAdapter management
  surface, but does not retrieve knowledge from a real index.

Candidate V2 value:

- Improve requirement review, case generation, and failure analysis with
  retrieved project knowledge while preserving evidence traceability.

Smallest slice:

- Add a local-only KnowledgeAdapter stub that can return deterministic matches
  from existing ContextArtifact text.
- Record retrieved artifact ids, snippets, and scores in AITask metadata.
- Keep vector database, external provider calls, reranking, and background
  indexing out until this deterministic slice is accepted.

Risks:

- Easy to overbuild into full search infrastructure.
- Evidence quality can degrade if retrieved snippets are not visible and
  reviewable.

Recommended only if:

- The next product priority is better AI context quality.

## Candidate Direction B: Tool And Runner Expansion

Problem:

- V1 supports pytest and Playwright evidence loops, with Newman/JMeter/Appium
  left as roadmap tools.

Candidate V2 value:

- Expand practical test execution coverage while preserving ToolDefinition
  allowlists and approval gates.

Smallest slice:

- Add one new runner path, preferably Newman API execution, because API tests
  are closer to existing command/artifact contracts than performance or mobile
  automation.
- Record stdout/stderr, report artifacts, command allowlist, and sandbox
  metadata.
- Add one golden smoke and one frontend shell update.

Risks:

- Tool execution can become arbitrary shell execution if allowlists are weak.
- Broad runner support can distract from evidence quality.

Recommended only if:

- The next product priority is broader daily testing workflow coverage.

## Candidate Direction C: Team Review And Governance

Problem:

- V1 is single-user and local-first. It has review states, but not team roles or
  enterprise governance.

Candidate V2 value:

- Add lightweight collaboration around review ownership without becoming a full
  enterprise RBAC platform.

Smallest slice:

- Add reviewer attribution and local review history for TestCase,
  AutomationDraft, UnitTestPatch, and QualityGateDecision.
- Keep tenants, roles, permissions, departments, SSO, and enterprise audit out
  until explicitly approved.

Risks:

- This can quickly become RBAC/tenant design work.
- Collaboration can conflict with the local-first product stance.

Recommended only if:

- The next product priority is team handoff and review accountability.

## Candidate Direction D: CI/CD Integration Bridge

Problem:

- V1 CI/CD Quality Center is local diff based and deliberately not a remote
  CI/CD provider integration.

Candidate V2 value:

- Let users import CI evidence while keeping Chtest as the evidence workbench,
  not a deployment system.

Smallest slice:

- Add import-only CI run metadata from a static JSON fixture or uploaded file.
- Map imported status, changed files, and artifacts into CICDRun evidence.
- Do not trigger remote pipelines, comment on PRs, deploy, or manage releases.

Risks:

- Remote authentication and provider APIs can consume the whole roadmap.
- PR comments and release automation would change the product boundary.

Recommended only if:

- The next product priority is connecting Chtest evidence to existing CI data.

## Recommended First V2 Slice

Recommended: Candidate Direction B, Newman API execution.

Why:

- It extends the existing runner/evidence architecture without requiring
  multi-user governance, vector infrastructure, or remote provider
  authentication.
- It fits the current ToolDefinition, TestCommand, TestRun, Artifact, Report,
  and frontend execution-center patterns.
- It gives visible user value while keeping scope small and testable.

First slice name:

```text
Slice 18: Newman API Execution
```

Suggested first task:

```text
V2 Task 2: Draft Slice 18 Newman API Execution plan
```

Expected output:

- A slice plan under `docs/implementation/slices/`.
- No product code until the plan defines models/APIs/artifacts/state
  boundaries.
- Verification command and non-goals listed before implementation starts.

## Still Out Of Scope Until Explicitly Promoted

- Full RAG platform, vector database, embeddings service, reranking service.
- MCP runtime, remote MCP calls, marketplace, or plugin installation.
- RBAC, tenants, departments, SSO, permissions, enterprise audit.
- Remote CI/CD provider control, PR comment bots, deployment automation,
  release automation.
- Broad dashboards, model leaderboard, or benchmark platform.
- Unapproved AI changes to business source files.

## Next Task

Draft Slice 18 Newman API Execution plan or pause for product review.
