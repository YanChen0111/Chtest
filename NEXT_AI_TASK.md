# Next AI Task

This file is the short operational handoff for the next Chtest AI coding session.
Update it whenever the active task changes. It is intentionally smaller than the
full docs so an AI worker can start fast without rereading the full planning set.

## Current Slice

V1 Completion Review.

## Current Task

Task 2: Run V1 release acceptance.

## Product Value Answer

After this task, Chtest has a release-acceptance record with full golden smoke
results, frontend verification, remaining release risks, and a clear go/no-go
recommendation for V1.

## Must Read

1. `START_HERE_FOR_AI.md`
2. `docs/implementation/02-v1-slice-plan.md`
3. `docs/product/01-positioning-and-scope.md`
4. `docs/contracts/01-data-model-contract.md`
5. `docs/contracts/02-api-contract.md`
6. `docs/contracts/03-state-machines.md`
7. `docs/contracts/04-artifact-contract.md`
8. `docs/implementation/04-ai-vibecoding-governance.md`
9. `docs/implementation/00-v0.1-walking-skeleton.md`
10. `docs/fixtures/00-v1-demo-path.md`
11. `docs/implementation/slices/slice-17-extension-surface.md`
12. `docs/implementation/06-v1-completion-audit.md`

## Do Not Read Unless Needed

- RAG runtime, MCP runtime, RBAC, tenants, permissions, release management, and
  remote CI provider integration docs unless a concrete blocker requires them.

## Expected Files

Create or update only these files for the current task:

```text
NEXT_AI_TASK.md
memory/08-session-handoff.md
memory/07-dev-log.md
docs/implementation/07-v1-release-acceptance.md
```

Acceptance-only task. Do not add product code, RAG runtime, MCP runtime, RBAC,
tenants, permissions, marketplace, cloud sync, release automation, or remote CI
provider integration.

## Verification Command

```bash
backend/.venv/bin/python -m pytest backend/app/tests/golden/test_requirement_to_case.py backend/app/tests/golden/test_requirement_to_case_metrics.py backend/app/tests/golden/test_test_case_library_golden.py backend/app/tests/golden/test_automation_draft_golden.py backend/app/tests/golden/test_testrunner_pytest_golden.py backend/app/tests/golden/test_playwright_minimal_loop_golden.py backend/app/tests/golden/test_report_failure_analysis_golden.py backend/app/tests/golden/test_cicd_quality_center_golden.py backend/app/tests/golden/test_unit_test_patch_regression_golden.py backend/app/tests/golden/test_extension_surface_golden.py -q
npm --prefix frontend run test -- --run
git diff --check
```

Expected result: all V1 golden smokes, frontend tests, and diff check pass or
document a concrete blocker.

## Acceptance

- Runs the full V1 release-acceptance verification command set.
- Creates `docs/implementation/07-v1-release-acceptance.md`.
- Records pass/fail results and remaining release risks.
- Provides a go/no-go recommendation.
- Keeps V1 non-goals out of scope.

## Commit Message

```text
docs(v1): add release acceptance report
```

## Next Task

Release readiness cleanup or V1 acceptance handoff based on report outcome.
